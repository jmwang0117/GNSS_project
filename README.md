# GNSS_project
For many years, our country has been affected by geological disasters. Whether it is the safety of peopleâ€™s lives or the safety of national property, there are great hidden dangers, which mainly include landslides, mudslides, collapses, ground collapses and cracks. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen the monitoring and prevention of geological disasters. The geological disaster monitoring system developed by this project covers multiple types of monitoring sensors such as GNSS, soil moisture sensors, rain gauges, temperature and humidity sensors, multiple communication systems, wind and solar power supply systems, industrial-grade lightning protection systems and professional deformation monitoring data processing Analysis software, various application client software, etc., can adopt different combinations for different types of monitoring projects to provide users with the most optimized, most reliable, and most effective deformation monitoring system solution.
